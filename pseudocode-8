INPUT Num
Sum=0
DO
  R=Num % 10
  Sum=Sum+R
  Q=Num/10
  Num=Q
WHILE Q>0
OUTPUT Sum

my understanding:
initialize sum to 0. get last digit og number by mod 10, save it in the variable R. update sum by sum +R.get rest of the number by num/10 and save it in Q. 
If Q is zero that means the number is finished and we can output sum.if it is not 0 then num=Q
