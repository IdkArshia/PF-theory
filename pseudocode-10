//2nd loop to reverse the string

  FNum=FNum&x

OUTPUT FNum

My Understanding:
the first loop gets the last digit of the number by mod 10 and saves it in R.
if R is not 9 then it is cancatinated with an empty string called RNum.If R is 9, then it removes the last digit, which would be 0,
from RNum by mod 10 and then cancatinates R with RNum.Number is updated by number/10.This repeats till number becomes 0.
Now RNum is a reverse string of the orignal number but wuthout zeros. we reverse this string by getting last digit by mod 10 
and cancatinating it with an empty string. Update RNum by RNum/10.Repeat this until RNum=0. Output FNum
